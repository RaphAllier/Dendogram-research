# Dendogram 

**Definition**: A dendrogram is a graphical representation of different aggregations made during a cluster analysis. It consists of knots that correspond to groups and branches that represent the associations made at each step. The structure of the dendrogram is determined by the order in which the aggregations are made. [1]
It comes from Greek "dendo" meaning tree, and "gramma", meaning analysis.
