# Dendogram 

**Definition**: A dendrogram is a graphical representation of different aggregations made during a cluster analysis. It consists of knots that correspond to groups and branches that represent the associations made at each step. The structure of the dendrogram is determined by the order in which the aggregations are made. [1]
It comes from Greek "dendo" meaning tree, and "gramma", meaning analysis.

## 1. Historical examples

The first examples of dendograms were the phylogenetic trees (a tree that shows the inferred evolutionnary relationships among various biological species) by systematic specialists. The term "dendogram" looks to have been used for the first time in the work of Mayr et al in 1953 [1].

Most of the time Dendograms are used in biology to describe the evolution of species. 

However they are also present in algorithms in cluster analysis. On a set of objects, a dendogram allows to depict aggregations being made over iterations (the aggregations are made following a distance table that is computed at each iteration). Once all of the instances have been linked through the iterations, the dataset can be cut into clusters where the distance between instances is minimal within a cluster.
